# ngCordovaOauth with FB code instead of token

This library is a fork of library originally created by [nraboy](https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth).
It is created to demonstrate how to use cordova Oauth with Facebook and receive code instead of token.
Attention! Since it is created for study purposes only, I've only made changes to the non-minified version of dist (ng-cordova-oauth.js).
